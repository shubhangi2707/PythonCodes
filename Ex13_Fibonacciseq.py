"""Ques 13: Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. 
Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of sequence to generate.
(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the 
previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)"""
